The Search Bar plugin allows users to search the web (YouTube.com by default) for videos and displays the search results as a playlist.


---


There are four parameters:

  * **Color** - The colour of the search bar button
  * **Label** - The text on the search button
  * **Position** - top or bottom. The position of the search bar
  * **Script** - The search script to use which returns a video playlist. By default it uses the YouTube.com search API. You could also use 3rd party custom scripts to search your course files directory, for example.

**Please note**: The search results are returned as a playlist. A playlist should be configured to make best use of the Search Bar plugin. If one is not set, a default playlist is created to the right of the Media Player window.
