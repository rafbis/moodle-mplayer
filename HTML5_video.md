## HTML 5 video ##

The Media Player module provides support for HTML5 video. If a user's operating system blocks Flash and their web browser supports HTML5 video playback, they will still be able to view the video. This means that iPhone and iPad users can now watch videos deployed in Moodle.

## Caveats ##

  * HTML5 video is basic video playback. The browser plays the video file natively and provides the playback controls so no skinning is possible.
  * None of the advanced features and plugins of the Flash media player are available.
  * No standard CODEC. Different browsers support different CODECs so expect compatibility issues with different MIME types. iOS, i.e. iPhone and iPad uses H.264 in an MP4 container.

## The bottom line ##

If you want advanced, interactive video features and support for accessibility and 508 compliance, choose an operating system that supports Flash!
