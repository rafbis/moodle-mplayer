The Metaviewer plugin displays all the available metadata contained within the video file currently being played. It's useful for finding out information such as width and height of the video, frame rate, running time, video CODEC, embedded captions and cue points, etc.

There are two parameters:

  * **Position** - over, left, right, top or bottom
  * **Size** - Width or height of the metadata display in pixels
